// Message1 is a test message.
const Message1 = `Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in
nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. God Himself is
not secure, having given man dominion over His works! Avoiding danger is no
safer in the long run than outright exposure. The fearful are caught as often
as the bold. Faith alone defends. Life is either a daring adventure or
nothing. To keep our faces toward change and behave like free spirits in the
presence of fate is strength undefeatable. — Helen Keller, 1940`

// Message2 is a test message.
const Message2 = `Computing spread out much, much faster than educating
unsophisticated people can happen. In the last 25 years or so, we actually got
something like a pop culture, similar to what happened when television came on
the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting
Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more
sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare. What
television was able to do was to capture people as they were. So I think the
lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software
engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture. — Alan Kay, 2004`
